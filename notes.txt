mc(i) = w(i)-w(i-1)
es(i) = w(i)/i

make graphs!


paper idea:
- lp for z-cover k-strong PoA
  Q: how to verify correct?
    - normalize w(1) - drb thinks my stuff shouldn't be working bc w(1)=0
    - look at screwing with I for Z > 1
- numerically explore various util functions
- generate worst-case examples (suprised at 1/37 got n=20, k=2, z=2)
  - run austin's algo suite on these
- main idea? can we emulate collaboration with randomization
- or: random is better than bad collab?

construct worst case games, does/can we show that one agent flipping "cascades" to opt?
